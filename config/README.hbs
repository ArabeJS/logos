SVG Logos
====================
#### A collection of 900+ svg vector logos.
All the logos are optimized (removed duplicated paths / excessive grouping / empty defs, linting, etc).

## Contributing
Since I optimize all the files manually I won't accept pull requests with new logos.
Please add your requests in the issues preferably with links to the vector files.

## Tips for SVGs
* Always convert borders to paths. They use a fixed size and behave strangely when resized.
* Join all the paths into one and use it as a background/mask. Or at least overlap your paths.

*All logos appearing on the site are the property of their respective owners.*
